# NVIM
This is my neovim setup

## Setup
1. if you haven't install neovim in your machine you can directly go with this link [Here](If you haven't already, install the latest stable release of neovim. Refer to this link for neovim installation)
2. `git clone https://github.com/zneret03/nvim_setup`
3. if you are using wsl
   ```
   $ cd .config/
   $ git clone https://github.com/zneret03/nvim_setup
   $ nvim . 
   ```
4. Save file with :w. This will trigger the installation for the plugins. `Note: if installation fails, just try again. It will succeed the second time`
